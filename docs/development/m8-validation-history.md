# M8 validation history

This retained snapshot separates experiment history from current status. It does
not remove completion conditions or establish new acceptance. See the
[current roadmap](roadmap.md) and [original requirements](roadmap-history.md).

## Retained roadmap evidence — 2026-10-28

## Current work: M8.0

Port reads, several CRUD operations, Port2 append/replacement/logical deletion and
selected recovery/retirement flows already have evidence. Those do not complete
native port services. The active dependency is execution-reference coverage for
safe movement and library registration; sound compatibility is not its prerequisite.
Submitted guarded TEMP traversal records allocation boundaries/footer dependencies;
candidate sanitizers/analysis/docs pass and its 59,656-byte image and launchers
match both-model native cache round trips. Full opaque/banked
provenance and public registration remain open.

Submitted guarded dispatch decoding retains both caller-proven schemas' read dependencies without interpreting scalar type IDs as pointers. Sanitizer and ARM checks pass; retained two-model fixtures cover 42 entries and 332 observer interruptions. Prior Quality formatting failures were corrected without changing the Python AST. Current native CI failures and local fixes are tracked below. Complete handler identity, embedded-code provenance and execution-reference coverage remain open.

Port2 startup: supported-ID-769 HP49g+ passes guarded low-memory recovery, repeated restart, absent-reservation recovery and all 16 rejection cases, including independent saved-state checks. HP50g now also passes absent-reservation recovery after revalidating its guarded/restart checkpoints; its 16 rejection cases are running. Guarded cases retain 23,900 user elements. Earlier complete two-model results use ID1701. Fourteen configured Stock libraries precede ID769; complete startup safety remains open.

Local explicit-ID follow-up: primary `4c0f6044`, delivery `2dcb4aa5` (not pushed). The harness records the library ID, rejects unsupported IDs before fixture creation and rejects mismatched witness bindings. All 73 recovery Python tests and Ruff checks pass on both branches; ID769 witness packages match both retained native fixtures byte-for-byte. HP49g+ ran the preceding harness; HP50g missing phases use the explicit-ID helper. These are local results, not CI acceptance.

Submitted #24 `6ff8a1e9` passes local validation of all six Stock object-mutation lifecycles: three invocations per classic model and 15 per HP39 model, totaling 54 phases with settled return. The native wrapper reserves 240 bytes instead of 16 without weakening page fences. All three payloads/result addresses and six launchers remain identical after accepted-main integration. Ten fresh HP49g+/HP50g detach, reattach and cache cases also pass with the packed HOME snapshot; saved states, input hashes and every fixture package independently verify. Sanitizers, ARM analysis, envelope checks, formatting and strict docs pass. Last inspected #24 `6ff8a1e9`: 12 workflows (four successful, one running, seven queued); 53 jobs successful, eight running and 135 queued. This is a live CI snapshot, not acceptance.

Prior #24 `0e68b3b1` finished with 345 successful jobs, two skipped, eight failures and one cancelled publisher. All eight failure snapshots confirm two causes: Port0 needs 64 growth nibbles with only 13 available; the test HOME snapshot requests 246,907 bytes against 229,376 total RW bytes. The fixes reserve Stock growth space and pack the complete snapshot into 123,454 bytes. Publisher annotations confirm cancellation by a higher-priority waiting ci-evidence-publisher request. All preceding workflows/jobs were inspected before this delivery; that failed head is not accepted.

Current implementation and evidence:

- Draft [#24](https://github.com/maxmixalex/hpclang/pull/24), `6ff8a1e9`, submits
  guarded internal catalog insertion/removal, proven-reference/register repairs,
  physical mapping/alias checks, Port1 commit errors and native-page fences.
  Removal revalidates bindings, contracts metadata/TEMP/return-stack storage and
  publishes count last. Sanitizers cover no-write rejection and commit failures;
  ARM analysis and strict docs pass. The submitted follow-up rejects HOME-attached
  IDs and malformed/unreadable attachment prefixes before removal writes;
  sanitizer and ARM checks pass. The preceding 56,016-byte build matches four
  original Stock cases on HP49g+/HP50g, including BUSY/no-write rejection for
  genuinely attached library 275. Internal HOME detachment now moves its prefix
  while preserving directory-object addresses; sanitizer fault tests and ARM
  analysis pass. Both HP49g+/HP50g native detachment cases now return to Stock
  with the directory body and surviving attachments preserved; 372 binding,
  100 entry and 66 attachment corruption controls reject. The preceding 56,800-byte
  candidate and both launchers match those two tested detachment cases; candidate
  sanitizers and strict docs pass. Public unload/provenance and CI remain open.
- Submitted HOME attachment now appends caller-proven fields, repairs the moving
  prefix and publishes count last. Sanitizers cover empty/populated tables,
  attach/detach round trips, eight no-write rejection cases and every commit
  write boundary. ARM analysis/docs pass. Both HP49g+/HP50g native reattachment
  cases return to Stock with directory contents and all attachment fields intact;
  372 binding, 100 entry and 72 attachment corruption controls reject.
  The 57,680-byte candidate and both launchers match the tested reattachment
  artifacts; candidate sanitizers/docs pass. Submitted identity-checked hash/message
  resolution matches 24 original HOME records after real ROM bank switches;
  312 header corruptions reject, with sanitizers/ARM analysis/docs passing.
  Submitted DOACPTR cache insertion/removal now initializes 15-nibble objects before
  publishing geometry and rejects live references on removal. Sanitizers cover
  round trips, adjacent objects, exact field boundaries and every write cut; ARM
  analysis/docs pass. HP49g+/HP50g native cache round trips allocate and
  attach two wrappers, reject removal while attached, reclaim them and restore
  original fields/cache/roots before Stock return. Independent controls reject
  372 bindings, 100 entry records and 72 attachment fields. The delivery image
  and both launchers match the tested 59,280-byte build; candidate checks pass.
  Submitted ROM name lookup through new wrappers now matches unmodified Stock on
  both models; 62 corrupt program encodings reject. Removing HOME's hash pointer
  on HP50g yields an unresolved global name instead of the library command.
  Message compatibility also passes on both models with 108 corruption controls,
  but clearing/redirecting HOME's message field still returns the original message.
  This does not prove use of the new message wrapper. A new Port0 library now
  returns its unique message on both models only while its catalog record exists;
  all four registered/unregistered cases pass, with 476 source corruptions rejected.
  The submitted 59,352-byte image and launchers match those cases and also pass
  fresh command-name lookup on both models. Candidate analysis/lint/docs pass.
  Built-in message routing, lifetime/transaction integration, configuration,
  public registration/provenance and CI acceptance remain open.
- Original-ROM checks cover selected transfers, descriptors, MMU preparation
  and returns. Submitted PrRUN helper execution now runs real SVC allocation/free
  services to stage0: 32 two-model baseline/move cases, 16 legacy prefix cases
  and eight corrupt-input controls pass. The direct helper branch grows the
  pool from 78 to 98 pages. Submitted stage0 rejection now executes the original
  free service and real interpreter return: 48 invalid-pool cases, 32 baseline
  cases and two omitted-free controls pass. Submitted stage0-to-stage1 entry now
  passes 16 two-model/cursor cases and six copy/clear/ABI omission controls;
  every image/zero-tail byte must be written. Translation uses modeled physical
  page aliases. Normal application execution/exit and the helper MMU branch
  remain open; this entry check neither executes nor simulates a return.
  Candidate-local reruns pass; this private-state matrix is separate from CI,
  whose ordinary fixture is rejected by the pinned cache-layout check.
  Native-entry observations and original Stock returns provide separate evidence.
  See the [maintained checks](https://github.com/maxmixalex/hpclang/blob/0e68b3b1/docs/development/e2e.md#offline-original-rom-threaded-return-check)
  for exact preconditions, controls and remaining opaque/banked-reference gaps.
- Recovery retests retain guarded/repeated/absent recovery and 16 rejection
  cases per model, with measured admission/recovery bounds. Port1 append retains
  109 write-failure boundaries and two success cases. The submitted public adapter
  now stops on incomplete native publication rather than returning a normal error;
  ten publication cuts, two recoverable body faults and both exit regressions
  pass, with ARM build/analysis and docs. Public library registration, Port1
  replace/remove and Port2 startup/reclamation remain open.

- Submitted Port0 commit-failure handling passes four operation write-cut matrices, root-before-write and allocation/preflight controls, plus four public API terminal-path cases. Delivery sanitizers, ARM analysis and strict docs pass. The 62,088-byte image, both launchers and verifier inputs match four HP49g+/HP50g registered/unregistered message cases; 476 source corruptions reject. Included in #24 `0e68b3b1`; the current CI investigation is recorded above. Fresh delivery CI remains required; both parents are accepted.

Next actions, in order:

1. Complete launcher/opaque-object provenance and bank/register coverage for
   relocation plans before enabling public library management and Port1 edits.
2. PR #22 is accepted as `038b0f41`; M0–M7 summaries remain visible.
   PR #23 is accepted as `f806b299`: all ten exact-head workflows pass,
   with 373 successful jobs and one skipped. #24 integrates this accepted
   parent and passes the local follow-up checks above; fresh CI remains required.
   Earlier unrelated PWM/watchdog and transfer failures retain their documented
   limits; these fixes do not establish their causes.
3. Complete retained Port2 trusted recovery installation, authority lifecycle,
   safe startup and reclamation. Preserve the independent M8 stage requirements.
   During CI wait, UI pool/RW checks pass all six retained Stock CLI cases.
   Submitted #21 `00d5ddf1` adds UI budgets and watchdog diagnostics. Its fresh
   HP39g+ Stock immediate retest passes with settled return; the prior failure
   cause remains unproven. Full CI and total system peaks remain open.

## Current work

Port2 startup: supported-ID-769 HP49g+ passes guarded low-memory recovery, repeated restart, absent-reservation recovery and all 16 rejection cases, including independent saved-state checks. HP50g now also passes absent-reservation recovery after revalidating its guarded/restart checkpoints; its 16 rejection cases are running. Guarded cases retain 23,900 user elements. Earlier complete two-model results use ID1701. Fourteen configured Stock libraries precede ID769; complete startup safety remains open.

Local explicit-ID follow-up: primary `4c0f6044`, delivery `2dcb4aa5` (not pushed). The harness records the library ID, rejects unsupported IDs before fixture creation and rejects mismatched witness bindings. All 73 recovery Python tests and Ruff checks pass on both branches; ID769 witness packages match both retained native fixtures byte-for-byte. HP49g+ ran the preceding harness; HP50g missing phases use the explicit-ID helper. These are local results, not CI acceptance.

Submitted #24 `6ff8a1e9` passes local validation of all six Stock object-mutation lifecycles: three invocations per classic model and 15 per HP39 model, totaling 54 phases with settled return. The native wrapper reserves 240 bytes instead of 16 without weakening page fences. All three payloads/result addresses and six launchers remain identical after accepted-main integration. Ten fresh HP49g+/HP50g detach, reattach and cache cases also pass with the packed HOME snapshot; saved states, input hashes and every fixture package independently verify. Sanitizers, ARM analysis, envelope checks, formatting and strict docs pass. Last inspected #24 `6ff8a1e9`: 12 workflows (four successful, one running, seven queued); 53 jobs successful, eight running and 135 queued. This is a live CI snapshot, not acceptance.

Prior #24 `0e68b3b1` finished with 345 successful jobs, two skipped, eight failures and one cancelled publisher. All eight failure snapshots confirm two causes: Port0 needs 64 growth nibbles with only 13 available; the test HOME snapshot requests 246,907 bytes against 229,376 total RW bytes. The fixes reserve Stock growth space and pack the complete snapshot into 123,454 bytes. Publisher annotations confirm cancellation by a higher-priority waiting ci-evidence-publisher request. All preceding workflows/jobs were inspected before this delivery; that failed head is not accepted.

Submitted guarded dispatch decoding retains both caller-proven schemas' read dependencies without interpreting scalar type IDs as pointers. Sanitizer and ARM checks pass; retained two-model fixtures cover 42 entries and 332 observer interruptions. Prior Quality formatting failures were corrected without changing the Python AST. Current native CI failures and local fixes are tracked below. Complete handler identity, embedded-code provenance and execution-reference coverage remain open.

1. Draft [#24](https://github.com/maxmixalex/hpclang/pull/24), `6ff8a1e9`, delivers guarded internal catalog insertion/removal, register/embedded repairs, physical mapping and alias checks, native-page fences and Port1 commit-failure handling. Removal validates bindings, contracts metadata/TEMP/return-stack storage and publishes count last. Candidate sanitizer fault tests, ARM analysis and strict docs pass. The submitted follow-up validates the entire HOME attachment prefix and rejects still-attached IDs before removal writes; seven no-write rejection cases, prefix read/encoding controls, sanitizers, ARM analysis and docs pass. The preceding 56,016-byte build passes all four HP49g+/HP50g original-return cases, including BUSY/zero-write checks against genuinely attached library 275; 750 binding and 200 entry corruption controls reject. Internal HOME detachment now preserves following directory-object addresses while moving and repairing the stack/HOME prefix; first/middle/last/sole cases, no-write rejection and every commit write boundary pass under sanitizers, with ARM analysis and docs. Both HP49g+/HP50g native detachment cases now pass with original Stock return, unchanged HOME directory body and preserved surviving attachments; independent checks reject 372 binding, 100 entry and 66 attachment corruptions. Detachment implementation/tests are submitted: the preceding 56,800-byte candidate image and both launchers match the two tested cases, and candidate sanitizers/docs pass; public unload, complete roots/provenance and CI acceptance remain open. Submitted PrRUN helper execution now follows real SVC allocation/free services to stage0: 32 two-model baseline/move cases, 16 legacy prefix cases and eight corrupt-input controls pass. It preserves 78 initial pages and appends 20. The direct-helper mode simulates payload return. Submitted stage0 rejection now executes real ROM free and the original interpreter return: 48 cases across two models, eight cursors and page counts 0/1/257 pass, alongside 32 baseline cases and two omitted-free controls. The pool table/vector and return-state invariants hold. Submitted stage0-to-stage1 entry now passes 16 two-model/cursor cases and six omitted-copy/clear or wrong-model controls, requiring actual writes across the complete image/zero tail. It models physical page aliases and stops before stage1 executes, without a real or simulated return. Normal application execution/exit, whole-heap leak freedom, complete launcher execution and the helper MMU branch remain open. Candidate-local reruns pass; the private-state matrix is explicitly separate from ordinary CI, whose standard fixture fails the pinned cache-layout check.
2. Submitted HOME attachment appends caller-proven fields, repairs the moving prefix and publishes count last. ASan/UBSan covers empty/populated tables, attach/detach round trips, eight no-write rejections and every commit write boundary; ARM analysis and strict docs pass. Both HP49g+/HP50g native reattachment cases return to Stock with unchanged directory contents and complete expected attachment records. Independent checks reject 372 binding, 100 entry and 72 attachment corruptions. The 57,680-byte candidate image, both launchers and verifier inputs match the tested reattachment artifacts; candidate sanitizers/docs pass. Submitted library-ID-checked hash/message resolution matches 24 original HOME records after real ROM bank switching; 312 header corruptions reject. Sanitizers, ARM analysis and docs pass. Banked HOME fields require separately owned DOACPTR wrappers, while direct fields retain their original table pointers. Submitted DOACPTR cache insertion/removal initializes complete 15-nibble objects before publishing geometry and rejects live references before removal. Sanitizers pass round trips, adjacent-object retention, exact field/register boundaries, no-write rejections and every write cut; ARM analysis and strict docs pass. Local HP49g+/HP50g native cache round trips allocate and attach two new wrappers, reject removal while attached, detach/reclaim them and restore original fields, cache extent, accounting and roots before Stock return. The delivery image, both launchers and verifier inputs match the tested 59,280-byte build; candidate sanitizer tests, ARM analysis and strict docs pass; independent controls reject 372 bindings, 100 entry records and 72 attachment fields. Local ROM command-name lookup through retained new wrappers matches the complete unmodified Stock program encoding on HP49g+/HP50g; 62 corrupt program nibbles reject. An HP50g control removing only HOME's hash pointer yields the unresolved global name PrRUN instead of ROMPTR 275/0. Local message compatibility matches original Stock on both models; 108 corrupt message-object nibbles reject. HP50g still returns the original message when HOME's message field is zero or redirected, so this does not prove use of the new message wrapper. Submitted lookup and message tests now include a new Port0 library that returns its unique message on HP49g+/HP50g only while its catalog record exists: four registered/unregistered cases pass locally, and 476 source corruptions reject. The submitted 59,352-byte image and launchers match those four cases and also pass fresh command-name lookup on both models; candidate ARM analysis, lint and strict docs pass. Built-in message routing, lifetime/transaction integration, library configuration, public registration/provenance and CI acceptance remain open. The current delivery and CI investigation are recorded above; earlier artifact-specific results remain retained.
3. Submitted guarded TEMP traversal protects allocation geometry/footer dependencies: candidate sanitizer fault tests, ARM analysis and strict docs pass. Its 59,656-byte image and launchers match both HP49g+/HP50g native cache round trips. Complete opaque/banked provenance, public library management, Port1 edits and Port2 trusted installation, authority lifecycle, startup and reclamation remain required. Recovery bounds and Port1 fault-injection evidence remain retained. The submitted public adapter now treats incomplete native publication as terminal: IRQ/FIQ are masked and ownership is retained without cleanup or Stock return. Ten publication cuts, two recoverable body faults and both exit regressions pass; ARM build/analysis and strict docs pass. Port1 replace/remove remain unavailable pending complete references. Port2 compromises affect sequencing, not M8 scope; sound compatibility is independent. Reproducible M8.0 details belong in tests, development docs and PR #24. The independent UI budget follow-up passes six exact workflow commands, archived-report selection and stale-report rejection. Submitted #21 `00d5ddf1` also retains existing watchdog diagnostics: prior Runtime job 121228920601 failed HP39g+ Stock system-services-immediate with 0x46417b8e; another same-head workflow passed. The fresh candidate retest passes with settled return; original cause remains unproven. Preceding-head workflows and jobs were inspected before push; new CI acceptance remains pending. This does not reduce Stock reservations or close M8.0/M8.2/M8.3.

Submitted Port0 commit-failure handling passes four operation write-cut matrices, root-before-write and allocation/preflight controls, plus four public API terminal-path cases. Delivery sanitizers, ARM analysis and strict docs pass. The 62,088-byte image, both launchers and verifier inputs match four HP49g+/HP50g registered/unregistered message cases; 476 source corruptions reject. Included in #24 `0e68b3b1`; see the current CI investigation above. Fresh delivery CI remains required; both parents are accepted.

## Pending delivery

| PR / head | Current acceptance state |
| --- | --- |
| #17 / `9e967d55` | Accepted and merged as `88aae022`: all 11 workflows pass, 379 successful checks and two skipped. Explicit opt-in legacy formatting and compact roadmap/archive delivered. |
| #18 / `439339b1` | HP49g+ Direct PWM IRQ failure `0x46417b03`; root cause unproven. |
| #20 / `41e35a36` | HP50g Direct system-services-exit PWM IRQ failure `0x46417b03`; root cause unproven. |
| #22 / `0c9db1cf` | Accepted and merged as `038b0f41`: all nine exact-head workflows pass, 354 successful jobs and two skipped. M0–M7 overview restored on main. |
| #23 / `7dadd8a0` | Accepted and merged as `f806b299`: all ten workflows pass, 373 successful jobs and one skipped. |
| #24 / `6ff8a1e9` | Accepted parents integrated. Growth reservation and packed HOME snapshot fixes pass 54 six-model lifecycle phases and ten native library cases locally. CI inspected: four workflows pass, one running and seven queued; not accepted. |

Earlier ID1701 recovery fixture retests pass on both models against the failed CI artifact: guarded/repeated/absent recovery and 16 rejection cases each. The measured free-space bounds remain valid. Earlier HP39 transfer stalls remain a separate acceptance gate. Submitted #24 includes native-page fence validation from `4c5546df`; later native-entry and continuation changes are test instrumentation. Native-entry observations are delivered in `c9dba0c2`, not CI-accepted.

## Scope and tracking

M0–M7 summaries are restored on main by accepted PR #22. Keep these summaries visible in the roadmap. All original milestone requirements remain in `docs/development/roadmap-history.md`. Keep current state here, reproducible details in tests/PRs, and history in the archive. Local passes, submitted CI, accepted delivery and milestone completion are distinct.

Before every push, inspect the preceding exact-head CI and investigate failures. Do not poll newly pushed CI in the same turn or merge unfinished gates. HP39gs/40gs ROM-write capability remains deferred research; no hardware flashing is authorized. Legacy formatting uses explicit `HPCLANG_HPGCC_LEGACY_FORMAT=1`.

## Resource observer main integration — local, 2026-10-29

PR20 head 1ce01859 passes all four workflows and 169 jobs, including publication.
GitHub reports conflicts with accepted main 3c484673 in roadmap and PWM IRQ test.
The local merge retains main's accepted IRQ/watchdog implementations unchanged
(both files byte-identical to main), which already include elapsed-time waits,
clock-error handling and failure preservation. Observer capture, independent
capacity verifier, UI lifecycle checks and workflow evidence remain present.
The roadmap keeps M0-M7 summaries and current compact status; branch-specific
historical evidence remains in prior commits, sdk-design and the history archive.
Six snapshot tests, seven verifier tests and five UI memory tests pass (18 total),
as do full tracked-file format/Ruff/ShellCheck and strict docs. Logs are retained
in `/work/oct29-resource-integration-quality` and `/work/oct29-resource-docs-check.log`.
The merged version requires fresh CI; neither parent CI nor this integration
completes M8.2/M8.3 or proves unsampled peak capacity.

## 2026-10-30 — PR26 HP39g+ runtime transfer failure and retry pacing

PR26 head `6a582958`, run 41024016583, job 123960548578 fails before application
entry: host-gate-failed, no PASS/return, zero payload keyboard frames, PC 0x44c4.
Directory transfer completed; payload send-window 57 stalled for 90 seconds,
with three NAKs and repeated identical retransmissions. All 1,668 audited data
and short ACK/NAK packets have valid length, sequence and CRC at socat. The
final device Timeout packet has a valid CRC but an invalid sequence field.
Evidence: `research/oct30-pr26-runtime-packet-audit.json` and downloaded artifacts
under `research/oct30-pr26-hp39-runtime-failure`. This does not locate the fault
inside the device/emulator or prove a native runtime regression.

The current mainline omitted `ckermit-resend-pacing.patch`, previously tested
on the still-unaccepted pacing branch. An isolated follow-up now applies it
and its PTY regression: retransmissions honor configured SET SEND PAUSE before
updating the RTT timestamp and sending the unchanged packet. Both the older
local server and the exact downloaded failing CI server fail the turnaround
negative test; a freshly compiled patched server passes the entire PTY suite.
Logs, binary and input hashes: `/work/oct30-kermit-retry`. Ruff and ShellCheck
pass. Existing x50ng cache keys already include the build script and all Kermit
patches, so this change invalidates the stale server bundle.
A replay under `/work/oct30-pr26-runtime-replay` uses exact CI application and
assets/emulator with only the Kermit executable replaced; it is still running.
Neither this diagnosis nor local protocol success waives remote CI failures.

The replay completed with exit 0: application PASS, all 52 keyboard frames
checked by the maintained harness, normal return and four settled-return
observations. Original CI asset files compare byte-for-byte; the final status,
input hashes and retained keyboard montage hash are recorded in
`/work/oct30-pr26-runtime-replay/verified.json`. Individual keyboard frames are
removed by the maintained harness after its count check and montage creation.
This local result supports delivery of the pacing correction, not acceptance
of #26 or proof that it explains every original packet-loss event.
